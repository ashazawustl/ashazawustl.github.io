                    Animals rely on sounds for survival, and social/reproductive interactions. Our brain must perform
                    the
                    challenging tasks of rapidly recognizing, categorizing, and assigning communicative importance to
                    sounds in a
                    noisy environment. The instructions to these functions are found in the precise connections neurons
                    make with
                    one another. We study evolutionarily conserved mechanisms for decoding social calls in the Auditory
                    Cortex of
                    rodents. The organization of the cerebral cortex may appear stereotyped, but new tools that allow
                    detailed
                    investigation of neural circuits have revealed significant differences between cortical areas that
                    perform
                    different functions. These circuit specializations embedded in stereotyped modules are now believed
                    to be the
                    secret ingredients that enable cortical areas to perform specific tasks. Our goal is to reveal these
                    unique
                    circuit features in the Auditory Cortex and determine their behavioral significance.

                    My research program seeks to understand the neural circuits underlying vocal communication.
                    Processing of conspecific vocalizations is lateralized in the human brain and other species, but
                    functional significance, mechanisms, and ontogeny of lateralization have remained a mystery for over
                    a century. My research group has focused on mice, which have become a viable model system to study
                    evolutionarily conserved mechanisms of vocal communication thanks to growing evidence of their vocal
                    repertoire’s complexity during social interactions and auditory plasticity triggered by parental
                    experience.

                    My laboratory leverages the cutting-edge tools available in rodents to study circuitry in the
                    context of species-specific vocalizations providing behavioral and computational constraints.
                    Processing social calls requires simultaneously recognizing, categorizing, and assigning
                    communicative importance to these fleeting signals. Lateralization—assigning specific computational
                    tasks to each cerebral hemisphere for parallel processing—is an important strategy to solve this
                    challenge. The novel approach of my research program has been to use lateralization as a comparative
                    tool to reveal molecular, structural and functional differences between the left and right Auditory
                    Cortices.

                <p class="p">
                    We have discovered lateralized processing of specific acoustic features in the mouse Auditory Cortex
                    and identified circuit asymmetries that could support the necessary specialized computations. We
                    plan to capitalize on these findings to determine the development and diversity of lateralized
                    cortical specializations, and how they go awry in communication disorders.
